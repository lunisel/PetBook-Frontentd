# PetBook
## Description
This is my final Capstone project of the Strive School Full-Stack web development course. This idea came to me because I have a dog and he is the light of my days, but walks can be lonely and boring, so i created this platform to let people meet other pet owners and to have a single place to track all of their pets information. I also did the backend for this app and you can find that in my repos with the name 'PetBook-Backend'
